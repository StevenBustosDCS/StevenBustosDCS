                                      <p>Automated Decision Making (ADM) systems are computerised processes that either assist or replace the judgement of human decision-makers. An example is the use of cameras to detect illegal mobile phone use by drivers in NSW. Not all ADM systems use AI technologies, although ADM system risks should still be minimised as they can be biased and have the potential to cause harm. As with the use of AI, the use of ADM systems should be made transparent, so customers have the option to challenge decisions or seek a review of adverse decisions where ADM has been used. For more information about ADMs, see the IPC ADM factsheet. </p>
